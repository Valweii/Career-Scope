# Career-Scope

**Career-Scope** is a project that helps users explore or predict career paths (or “career scope”) based on certain inputs or models.  
*(Note: This is inferred from the repository contents — refine as needed.)*

## About

Career-Scope is an application / model / tool (choose the right term) designed to help individuals understand potential career trajectories or make career predictions based on input features (such as skills, preferences, background).  

This repository includes a Jupyter notebook for experimentation, trained model files, preprocessing utilities, and serialized artifacts (e.g. scalers, encoders).

---

## Features

- Use a trained model (e.g. XGBoost) to predict career scope  
- Preprocessing and encoding of input features  
- Interactive / notebook-based exploration  
- (Optional) Web interface or app integration  
- Serialized artifacts for reuse (scalers, encoders, models)

## Repository Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the key files and folders (as visible in the repo):  

- **app.ipynb** — main notebook (data exploration, training, evaluation, prediction)  
- **label_encoders.pkl** — saved LabelEncoder(s) for categorical features  
- **scaler.pkl** — saved scaler (e.g. StandardScaler)  
- **xgb_model.pkl** — trained model (XGBoost)  
- **templates/** — folder for template files (e.g. HTML, config)  

You may also have utility modules (preprocessing, model wrappers) in templates or other subfolders.

## Installation

Here’s how to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Valweii/Career-Scope.git
   cd Career-Scope
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
3. Install dependencies
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost joblib

Usage
- Here’s a basic workflow for using Career-Scope:
- Open app.ipynb
- Scroll to the last cell (contains Flask app code)
- Run it — this will start the Flask server locally
- Open your browser and visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000


Model / Algorithms
- The core predictive model is XGBoost (hence xgb_model.pkl)
- Categorical features are encoded with one or more LabelEncoder objects (saved in label_encoders.pkl)
- Numeric features are scaled using a scaler (likely StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler, saved in scaler.pkl)
- Make sure that when using this model in production, you apply the exact same preprocessing pipeline as during training.
